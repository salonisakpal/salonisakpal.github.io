                        Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Saloni, and I am passionate about both web development and dancing. 
                        As a multi-talented individual, I have found joy in pursuing these two creative disciplines, constantly seeking ways to blend technology and artistry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <u>Web Development:</u><br>
                        With a strong foundation in web development, I strive to create immersive and engaging online experiences. 
                        From designing visually appealing user interfaces to developing robust and responsive websites, I enjoy the entire process of bringing ideas to life. 
                        My proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks allows me to craft modern, intuitive, and user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impression. 
                        I am also well-versed in backend technologies, enabling me to build dynamic and interactive web applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <u>Dancing:</u><br>
                        When I'm not immersed in the world of web development, you'll often find me in the dance studio, expressing myself through movement. 
                        Dance has been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember, and it has taught me discipline, creativity, and the importance of teamwork. I have trained extensively in various dance forms, including contemporary, jazz, and hip-hop. Through my performances, I aim to convey emotions, tell stories, and captivate audiences. 
                        Dance has given me a unique perspective on aesthetics, rhythm, and coordination, which I bring into my web development projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <u>Combining the Best of Both Worlds:</u><br>
                        What sets me apart is my ability to combine my technical expertise in web development with the fluidity and grace of dance. 
                        This fusion allows me to create websites that not only function flawlessly but also evoke an emotional response. I believe in the power of aesthetics, and I approach every project with a keen eye for detail, incorporating captivating visuals and intuitive user experiences. 
                        By infusing my designs with elements of movement, rhythm, and storytelling, I strive to engage users on a deeper level, making their online journeys memorable.
